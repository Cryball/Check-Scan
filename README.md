:iphone: :page_facing_up: **Check Scan** - App for scanning checks and money spending analysis

An application that allows you to scan checks and conveniently track your expenses throughout the month / year.

The main feature is the automatic sorting of check items into groups using computer vision:
this allows the user to get more detailed information about purchases and costs.
For example, when scanning a check from a grocery store, all your purchases will be categorized:
dairy products, meat products, groceries, pet products, and so on.

:warning: Computer vision part is stopped indefinitely.
